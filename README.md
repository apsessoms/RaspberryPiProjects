# Day 1 of Pi
If I could go back in time, I would be a Computer Science major. I love everything that has to do with technology and over the last four years I have lived, breathed, slept, and studied all things related to computers/technology/cloud computing/etc. Today, I had a bit of a "rookie" moment as I carried in my TV from the bedroom into my office to hook up the raspberry pi I purchased recently. I quickly realized I just needed to configured the device for SSH and I put the TV back....

I purchased a raspberry pi mainly to understand the Linux OS and to teach myself programming languages.
